        <h2>Your leap into the high-tech world</h2>
        <p id="article-p">Building efficient web and mobile interfaces is often challenging and requires the use of imperative logic. React enables you to declaratively describe user interfaces in terms of their state, and it will do the heavy lifting of natively building
